First observation, in 10 antenna compact configuration.
Excellent conditions. 3.5-sigma detections
Epoch 1: 4 Oct, Band 1

--------------------------------------

Epoch 2: All bands
Was the middle of a Global VLBI session, kind of a mess.
2mm was low elevation and more tricky. 3mm was also observed
that day, but technical problem and was observed again afterwards
(still trying to get something out o fthe first failed 3mm observation)
10 Oct, Band 2 * the observation that was tricky
11 Oct, Band 1 * the first failed 3mm observation
11 Oct: Band 3
12 Oct: Band 1  * observed again afterwards

What is this?
13 Oct, Band 1
14 Oct, Band 2

--------------------------------------

* Then there was a period of bad weather

Epoch 3
28 Oct: Band 1
29 Oct, Band 2 ... 309 +/- 33 uJy for 132 GHz...have to replace a bad result I think
1 Nov, Band 3 (Two distinct dates)
I have a note that Band 3 observations were obtained but under difficult weather conditions. No clear detection in the pipeline output.
But then in my notes I have a detection, so I don't know if that means
something changed. Should double check with Michael.

"s22db006
combines data from two distinct dates:
01-NOV-2022 23:03 - 02-NOV-2022 03:17 UT taken in 12C Fluxcal LKHA101
02-NOV-2022 21:14 - 02-NOV-2022 23:35 UT taken in 12C Fluxcal LKHA101"

--------------------------------------

Epoch 4
18 Nov, Band 1
26 Nov, Band 2...duplicate entry

--------------------------------------

Epoch 5
14 Dec, Band 1
